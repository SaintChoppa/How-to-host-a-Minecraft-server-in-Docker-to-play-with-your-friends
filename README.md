This repository will show the process of hosting a Minecraft server with or without mods using Docker.

Do you have a powerful PC and don't want to spend money hosting Minecraft servers?
In this repository, I'll show you the process for hosting a Minecraft server, along with my experience, mistakes, and potential problems you might encounter along the way.

# Technologies used
- Docker Desktop
- Any IDE (I used VSC)
- A powerful pc

# Step 1: Preparations
After deciding with your friends which version of Minecraft to play (Java or Bedrock) and the version along with the mods (if you are going to play with mods), it's time to install the necessary programs.

<h2> Install Docker </h2>
- Make sure you have Docker installed; install it [here](https://www.docker.com/).
